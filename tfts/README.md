The original source code is in the folder [hemoglobulopt of this repository](https://github.com/greenlsi/hemoglobulab_MSO/tree/master/hemoglobulopt). This model has been updated and improved in the [hemoglobulab_opt](https://github.com/greenlsi/hemoglobulab_opt/tree/master/hemoglobulopt) repository by Eduardo Abreu and Josué Pagán.
- Alfonso Escribano: [Bachelor Thesis](https://youtu.be/LXsRxujemeU) on the development of a smartphone app with gamification for the donor. It uses Flutter. The app has never been tested.
